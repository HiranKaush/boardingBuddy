# boardingBuddy
 The boarding buddy app is made using react native, mongo and firebase. This allows university students and other boarding seekers to find a boarding house very quickly and easily. In addition, you can get food from restaurants around the boarding house. When using this app, there is no need for a separate 3rd party app to talk to the tenant and the landlord. A real time chat has been implemented here.
